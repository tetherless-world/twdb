# TWKS project-wide scripts

The scripts in this directory follow the responsibilities of [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all). See that page for explanations of the various scripts.

The scripts only run on Unix (Linux or OS X) currently.

This directory only contains project-wide scripts. See the language-specific `script/` directories for language-specific scripts:

* [Java](../java/script/README.md)
* [Python](../py/script/README.md)

## Project-wide script prerequisites

* `server`:  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
