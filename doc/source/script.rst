Scripts to Rule Them All
=============================

Many of the second-level directories in the repository (e.g., ``java``) contain ``script`` directory.

The scripts in a ``script`` follow the responsibilities of `Scripts to Rule Them All <https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all>`_. See that page for explanations of the various scripts.

The scripts only run on Unix (Linux or OS X) currently.
