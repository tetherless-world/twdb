# TWKS Python scripts

The scripts in this directory follow the responsibilities of [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all). See that page for explanations of the various scripts.

The scripts only run on Unix (Linux or OS X) currently.

See [the parent README](../README.md) for script prerequisites.
